RMI application
For this Assignment, We had to implement a RMI server/client application with 5 unique services available for the client. 

Getting Started
You can simple run the server then the client and the GUI will appear to provide with the services.

Services in include:
 - No key Base64 Encryption
 - No Key Base64 Decryption
 - MD5 Hashing
 - Sha-1 Hashing
 - Base64 Encryption using a Key
 - Base64 Decryption using a Key
 - Base64 file encryption using a Key
 - Base64 file decryption using a Key

Give the example
1. Write a string in the topper text area then press Base64 Encrypt and the encrypted string will appear on the bottom text area
2. Copy the encrypted string from the previous service and past it in the upper text area and choose base64 Decrypt, the original string will appear in the bottom text area.
3.Covert any string using MD5 or Sha-1 hashing simply by writing the string the input area and choosing the desired hash function and the result will appear in the output area.
4. Encrypt any string using base64 but this service requires an encryption key
5. Decrypt the string using the same key
6. Encrypt a file using base64 encryption with a key
 *created test.txt then chose encrypted.txt as the encrypted file name with "sandra" as a key*
7. Decrypt the same file using the same key
 *Decrypted the encrypted.txt file and chose decrypted.txt as the decrypted file name*
